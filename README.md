# Py City Schools - Cheaters *Never* Prosper
## Objective
As stated, we have been made aware of academic dishonesty for the 9th grade test scores for Thomas High School. We had performed our analysis prior to being made aware. It is necessary we remove the scores from our data to create the most accurate data. Given only 461 students were removed form a data set 39,170; I wouldn't anticpate significant movement in our analysis.

Once we removed the students, we saw insignificant changes in the testing scores. With rounding, the changes were barely noticeable. 
## Summary of Thomas High School
Prior to removing the 9th graders' scores, we saw THS with low passing scores and overally passing scores.

After clean up, we saw a drastic increase in the school's passing percentages. One could conclude there was no advantage to cheating for our 9th graders.
