# Py City Schools - Cheaters *Never* Prosper
## Objective
As stated, we have been made aware of academic dishonesty for the 9th grade test scores for Thomas High School. We had performed our analysis prior to being made aware. It is necessary we remove the scores from our data to create the most accurate data. Given only 461 students were removed form a data set 39,170; I wouldn't anticpate significant movement in our analysis.

After clean up, we saw a drastic increase in the school's passing percentages. One could conclude there was no advantage to cheating for our 9th graders.
